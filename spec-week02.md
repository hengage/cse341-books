# Books API Week 02 Spec - Version 1

## Feature 1: Book CRUD Operations and Author References

### Goal
Update the existing Week 01 book API so book documents include a reference to an author and the API supports all CRUD operations for books. Every book route must be documented and testable in Swagger.

### Data Model
Book documents will be stored in the `books` collection.

Required book fields:
- `id`: string, required, custom id such as `b1`
- `authorId`: string, required, references the `id` field of an author document
- `title`: string, required
- `publicationDate`: string, required

Books will continue to use custom string ids instead of MongoDB `_id` values for route parameters.

### Relationship to Authors
Each book will identify its author with an `authorId` field. The value of `authorId` must match the custom `id` value of an existing author document.

When creating or updating a book, the API should reject the request with a `400` status code if the submitted `authorId` does not match an existing author.

### Routes

#### GET /books
Purpose: Return all books.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: an array of book objects

Errors:
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### GET /books/:id
Purpose: Return one book by its custom id.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the matching book object

Errors:
- `404` if no book exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### POST /books
Purpose: Create a new book.

Request body:

    {
      "id": "b4",
      "authorId": "a1",
      "title": "Example Book Title",
      "publicationDate": "2026-01-15"
    }

Success:
- Status code: `201`
- Response body: the newly created book object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the updated book object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing
- `400` if the `authorId` does not match an existing author
- `404` if no book exists with that id

### Swagger Documentation
Swagger must document every book route.

## Feature 2: Author CRUD Operations

### Goal
Implement full CRUD operations for an `authors` collection and ensure these routes are documented in Swagger.
